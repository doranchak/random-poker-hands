# random-poker-hands
Visualization of random poker hands being dealt.  Pressing a button freezes on a predetermined hand.

I made this (mostly with ChatGPT) to use as a quick visual for one of my videos.  Card graphics by Juha Lindstedt (https://github.com/deck-of-cards/standard-deck).

Live version can be seen here:  https://doranchak.github.io/random-poker-hands

Click the button to freeze the random hands, and again to resume.
